# Park_Notifier
An open sourced notifier for Recreation.gov permits and passes.

This program will email a user if a change is made on the recreation.gov website, indicating that there is an availability.

The version that this script was forked from was successfully used in the summers of 2017 and 2018 to get 8+ permits.
